\section*{Abstract}

We introduce \codename, the first protocol design for a high performance decentralized applications that allows high frequency interactions, low latency settlement and great interoperability. \codename is built on top of various technologies, including Plasma~\cite{plasma} and our previous work on sharding~\cite{elastico} and PeaceRelay~\cite{peacerelay}. The protocol theoretically allows for asymptotically optimal scaling up to millions of transactions per second, without compromise on security and decentralization. While this paper describes \codename in the context of decentralized exchanges, the approach can be applied to various other applications like gaming, payments, social networks and so on.
